This folder containts the data and matlab codes for product graph clustering using COIL-20 image dataset.


1. The code CoilData_PGL.m gives the view graph and object graph without any clusters in it.
The adjaceny matrices related to the the factor graphs are saved as 
	PGL_ObjectGraph.csv
	PGL_ViewGraph.csv

2. The code CoilData_RPGL.m gives the clustered view graph and the object graph.
The adjaceny matrix is saved as follows:
	RPGL_ObjectGraph.csv
	RPGL_ViewGraph.csv

	We also save the images related to the clusters in the same folder.

This folder contains the data and Matlab codes for product graph clustering using the COIL-20 image dataset.


1. The code CoilData_PGL.m gives the viewgraph and object graph without any clusters in it.
The adjacency matrices related to the factor graphs are 
	PGL_ObjectGraph.csv
	PGL_ViewGraph.csv

2. The code CoilData_RPGL.m gives the clustered view graph and the object graph.
The adjacency matrix of the objects and views are
	RPGL_ObjectGraph.csv
	RPGL_ViewGraph.csv

We also save the images related to the clusters in the same folder.

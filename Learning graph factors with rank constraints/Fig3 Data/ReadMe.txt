In this folder we give the data and matlab codes for obtaining the figure 3 of the paper.

1. Fig_3a.m is the code for generating the Fig_3a of the paper. We give the ground truth graphs Gp and Gq that we use for Product graph clustering (synthetic dataset)

2. Fig_3b.m is the code for generating the Fig_3b of the paper. Here, we give the obtained or estimated product graph factors Gp and Gq form the proposed Rank-constrained product graph learning (RPGL) method.

3. Fig_3c.m is the code for generating the Fig_3c of the paper. Here, we show the convergence of error of RPGL and R-KronFact which use alternating minimization.

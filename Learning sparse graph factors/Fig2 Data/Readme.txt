This folder has the files and data required for generating the Figure 2 in the paper.

We use the precomputed results, saved in mat format for generating the results.



1. Fig2a.m is the matlab code for generating the figure 2a of the paper. Here, we show the ground truth graphs Gp, Gq for the 
that we use for Product graph learning (synthetic dataset).

2. Fig_2b.m is the matlab code for generating the paper ready figures for Fig. 2b of the paper. Here, we 
plot for the Fmeasure (Community graphs) for comparison methods

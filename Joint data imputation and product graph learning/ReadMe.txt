This folder has the files and data we use for the Joint data imputation and product graph learning section of the paper.

AQI_Data.m -->
In this code, we apply the proposed (PGL) method for the task of joint data imputation and product graph learning.

Here, we use the PM 2.5 data collected across 30 air quality monitoring stations in India over 2018. 
The data is available at https://app.cpcbccr.com.

We preprocess the data and save it in the usable format in the file AQI_Data_WithCoords.mat. 
Here, we also give the latitude and longitude locations as the location coordinates for plotting the figures.

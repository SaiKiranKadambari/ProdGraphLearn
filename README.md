# Product Graph Learning and Clustering

We porpose an efficient graph learning algorithm, to learn the factor the product graph from multi-domain graph data.
Product graphs are useful to explain the complex realtions in the multidomain graph data.

Learning sparse graph factors - Learns a sparse Cartesian product graph with N nodes by learning its graph factor with smaller number of nodes.

Learning graph factors with rank constraints - Learns a K-component Cartesian product graph with N-nodes by estimating its graph factors with Kp and Kq components with K = KpKq.

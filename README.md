# Product Graph Learning and Clustering

Product graphs are useful to explain the complex relations in multidomain graph data.
We propose an efficient graph learning algorithm to learn the factor of the product graph from multidomain graph data.


Learning sparse graph factors: Learns a sparse Cartesian product graph with N nodes by estimating its graph factor with a smaller number of nodes.

Learning graph factors with rank constraints: Learns a K-component Cartesian product graph with N-nodes by estimating its graph factors with Kp and Kq components with K = KpKq.

Multi-view object clustering (COIL-20 dataset): This contains the data and files used to demonstrate product graph clustering using the COIL-20 image dataset. 

Joint data imputation and product graph learning: We demonstrate the performance of the product graph learning framework for imputing missing PM2.5 measurements in the air quality data collected across the 30 air quality monitoring stations located all over India for the year 2018.

TimeAnalysis: We compare per iteration runtime of the proposed methods and other baseline methods for different the number of nodes N in the product graph
